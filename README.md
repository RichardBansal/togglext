#togglext

## Synopsis

A chrome extention to push time tracking updates to <a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank">toggl's</a> API.

## Motivation

Having used toggl extensively for tracking time usage, I wanted to create a simple chrome extension to access the API instead of having to visit the site to start/stop a timer.

## Code Structure

The repository is split into two folders: 

####_public_
Chrome extension.

####_server_
Backend server acting as a proxy for making RESTful API calls to toggl.
